MATLAB autostart controller

This controller is a simple linear damping controller written in the MATLAB language.
It features a "autostart" function, which means that when running the script it will
start the COERbuoy platform, which will automatically connect to this controller.
However, when the controller is started from within the COERbuoy environment, the
autostart function must be deactivated.

# Get started:
Ensure that COERbuoy is properly installed.
Please set the correct python command for your system in line 33, then just start the script.
